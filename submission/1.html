            <td style="vertical-align: top;">This binned scatterplot shows the relationship between the maturity time
               of
               the male part and female part of a species. Each point represents a cluster of species that have around
               the
               the same male and female maturity time. Hovering over a point will reveal the maturity time of the sexes
               of the clustered species and how many species are in that range.</td>

            <td style="vertical-align: top;">
               In general, the visualization shows that the majority of species, that we have data for, have about the
               same maturity times for sexes. However, we can see there is a lot of noise around the centerline. We can
               also see that there are also more points above the centerline than below it which would suggest that we
               could, in general, say that a species sexes either have the same maturity time or the males have a
               longer maturity time.

               <p /> There is of course, as we can see, noise along the diagonal and outliers. However I would
               be quick to point out that there is a lot of data here and that the data on the diagonal far outnumbers
               the
               data not lying on the diagonal.

               <p> <strong>We cannot say if a mammals Sex has anything to do with how long it will take to
                     mature</strong> </p>

         <tr>
            <td style="vertical-align: top;"><strong>Design considerations</strong></td>
            <td style="vertical-align: top;">I have used a binned scatterplot as it is a very effective way to show the
               relationship between two quantitative variables, taking advantage of our ability to accurately perceive
               variation in both horizontal and vertical position. The reason I went with a binned scatterplot was so I
               could more accurately represent the data.
               <p />I considered using just a <a
                  href="https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/examples/point_2d.html">scatterplot</a> but
               since the data is clustered near the bottom it is hard to
               see
               just how many datapoints there are with a scatterplot. It would have suffered from overplotting.
               <p />I also considered using a <a
                  href="https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/examples/rect_binned_heatmap.html">binned heatmaps</a> but
               again since the data is clustered near the bottom the heatmap shows
               one big cluster and the rest of data appears as nothing in comparison.
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <td style="width: 200px; vertical-align: top;"><strong>Data filtering and transformation:&nbsp;</strong>
            </td>
            <td style="vertical-align: top;">
               The data has all classes of animals and this question was specificaly pertaining to mammals so I
               had to filter out animals not in the class Mammalia.
               <p />
               The data has some very strange outliers. There are 3 mammals which take over 10 years to mature and when
               we include these
               3 point in our plot it completely fails to convey the linear relationship that shows sex does not effect
               maturity time.
               So i filtered out any mammal that took over 10 years to mature

               <p /> There were also some mammals in my data that didn't have a maturity time recorded so I removed them
               using a filter also
